/**
 * Hyperapp wires your actions so the view is re-rendered every time the state
 * changes as a result of calling any action. This object is useful because it
 * allows you to talk to your app from another app, framework, vanilla JS, etc.

 * Here is an example on CodePen: https://codepen.io/selfup/pen/jLMRjO
